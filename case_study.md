# Mall Customers Analysis

## Dataset

You will be working with the following dataset: [Mall Customers](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python/data)

The dataset includes the following information about 200 customers:
- CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer
- Gender: Male or Female
- Age: Customer's age in years
- Annual Income (k$): Annual income in thousands of dollars
- Spending Score (1-100): A score that indicates spending habits and mall engagement

ðŸ“¦ **Dataset Download Instructions**
1. Download the dataset ZIP file from the above link.
2. After downloading: Unzip the file to access mall_customers.csv. Note the full file path to mall_customers.csv â€” you'll need it in the next step.

## Business Question
How can the mall boost spending by gaining an understanding to their customer base and their spending behaviours?

*To answer the above question, use pandas, matplotlib and seaborn to explore the dataset, visualise your findings and address the following questions:*

What's the most common gender? Does one gender tend to spend more on average?

Code:
```python

```
Findings:
```text

```
What's the most common age group? Which age group is the highest spenders?

Code:
```python

```
Findings:
```text

```
Which attribute is the highest driver behind spending? 
Hint: Which attribute has the highest correlation with spending

Code:
```python

```
Findings:
```text

```
Group customers by their spending score and compute their gender proportion, average age and annual income.
What are the characteristics of each group?

Code:
```python

```
Findings:
```text

```
## Deliverables:
- Python: Provide all the python code you used to answer the business questions.
- Summary of Findings: For each question, summarise your key findings and recommendations based on your analysis.
